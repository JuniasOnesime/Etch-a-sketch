# Etch-a-sketch
This project really came from deep , because it didn't take too much time to complete but it was a little bit tough for someone who is a beginner in javascript,html and css.
As mentioned above this project is a combination of javascript , html and css .
Etch-a-sketch  is a designed based project to be more explicit , it is a project where the desired output is to let the user design something by changing the background color of some small square to the color of his choice or to a random type of color to make the big sqare look good, beautiful and colorful.

So in the javascript file , you will see the use of so many function and most of the time the use of the DOM manipulation . 
the Html is a basic one , and as well as the Css file .
